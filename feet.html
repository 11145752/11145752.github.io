     <p>Invented by Edward Thorpe and Claude Shannon in 1961, the intriguing first example of wearable technology for footwear was a timing device small enough to fit in a shoe that could apparently improve the chances of winning at a roulette table by as much as 44%.
         Modern-day shoe wearables tend to be focussed more on wellbeing and physical performance though, using sensors embedded within footwear to identify many useful metrics associated with the wearer, including fluctuations in weight distribution and the wearerâ€™s actual weight. 
         These measurements can be particularly useful in healthcare and athletic performance, although other potential uses include military applications and scientific research.</p>
